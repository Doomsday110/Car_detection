Overview:  
This project aims to create a highly precise deep learning-based system for identifying cars in images. The system is intended for use in:  
1) Traffic Analysis  
2) Security Surveillance  
3) Autonomous Vehicles  
It is capable of detecting cars in a variety of images, including those not specifically included in its training.  

Features:  
1) High precision in car detection  
2) Functions on images beyond the training dataset  
3) Applicable in real-world scenarios
